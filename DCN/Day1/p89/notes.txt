- wireless 
  - medium: air (EM waves)


* connectors
- T-connector: with co-axial cable
- RJ45 connector: used with cat cable 
- RJ11 connector: used for telephony
- types
  - male
  - female


* topology
- physical arrangement of the devices 
- types
  - bus
  - ring
  - connected ring
  - star (*)
  - mesh


* smart device
- device with its own OS
  

* hub/switch/router

- hub
  - used to create LAN
  - is a physical (Layer 1) device
  - does not understand any addressing scheme
  - concerned with only the electrical signals
  - repeats the signal coming from one port to all the remaining ports
  - increases the traffic 
  - more collision
  - more data will be lost
  - degrade the performance

- switch
  - used to create LAN
  - is a data link (Layer 2) layer device
  - is a smart device
  - OS
    - Cisco  : Ios
    - Juniper: JunOS
  - understands the MAC address 
  - OS in switch maintain a MAC address table
  - performance is better than Hub

- router
  - used to create WAN


* casting
- unicasting  : sending to ONLY ONE device
- multicasting: sending to multiple (but not all) devices 
- broadcasting: sending to all the devices connected to the network


* network interface card (NIC)
  - contains the female network port (RJ45)
  - types
    - internal
      - on-board (on motherboard)
      - PCI internal NIC
    - external 
  - used to connect the device to the network
  - converts 
    - binary data to electrical signals
    - electrical signals to binary data


* addressing schemes

- MAC address
  - addressing scheme used on data link layer 
  - media access control
  - used to identify every NIC uniquely 
  - flashed on the ROM part of the NIC
  - CAN NOT BE CHANGED
  - also known as
    - read only address
    - physical address
    - real address
    - ethernet address
  - to find MAC address 
    - windows: ipconfig /all
    - linux/macOS: ifconfig

  - e.g.
    
    78:4f:43:90:13:d0

  - size: 6 bytes = 6 x 8 = 48 bits
  - importance
    - group of first 3 bytes:
      - will identify the manufacturer 
      - e.g. 78:4f:43
      - use
        - https://hwaddress.com
    - group of last 3 bytes
      - will identify the NIC uniquely
      - e.g. 90:13:d0
