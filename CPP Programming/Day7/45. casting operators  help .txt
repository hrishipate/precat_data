1. reinterpret_cast
it is used to convert pointer of any type into  pointer of any other type.
if you want to do type conversion between incompatible types then we should use
reinterpret_cast operator.

example : to access private data members of class using pointers

2. const_cast

if we want to convert pointer to constant object into pointer to non constant object
we should use const_const operator


3.static_cast
if we want to do type conversion between compatibale types then we should use
static_cast operator

4.
dynamic_cast
during type conversion if we want to check both that is inheritance relationship and type conversion is valid or not. we should use dynamic_cast operator.

to use dynamic_cast operator base class must be polymorphic this is it should have atleast one virtual function.
in case of polymorphic type, if we want to do downcasting then we should use dynamic_cast operator.
